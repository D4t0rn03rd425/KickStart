# description of my solution(s)

When looking at the test results after the event I realized that I only forgot to cast the values to an Integer when sorting by durability as requested for Charles.
Therefore, [fabric_test_set_1.py](fabric_test_set_1.py) is the solution I handed in during the event which passed test set 1.
The adapted version [fabric_test_set_2.py](fabric_test_set_2.py) can not be considered as a valid attempt as it was handed in after the event, but it also passes test set 2 ;)
